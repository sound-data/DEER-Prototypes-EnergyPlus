# Normalizing units for measure

The measure's normalizing unit is cooling capacity (detail in eTRM).
EnergyPlus does not autosize nor output design refrigeration compressor
capacity. However, the maximum capacity available from compressors can be
determined by inspecting the capacity performance curves, and hourly outputs
are available for cooling demand and cooling delivered to evaporators.

- Compressor capacity available: See [Gro compressor list.xlsx](Gro compressor list.xlsx).
- Cooling demand / capacity utilized: not analyzed.
