The *.FIN4 files use a fixed-field format that can be read by any text editor.  

Line 1 contains the following information on the weather station: Station Name, WMO Station Number, Latitude (N +, S-), Longitude (E +, W -), Elevation (m), WMO region number, Time Zone, ISO-3166 3-letter Country Code, and Koeppen Climate Classification. 
Lines 2 and 3 contain the self-describing column headers. The capital letters attached to some of the values indicate the value is interpolated, L = Linear, F = Fourier Series, R = Repeating, etc. 

To import a *.FIN4 file into Excel, please download this template file that uses VB to parse the data columns between values and the data quality   flags: http://www.whiteboxtechnologies.com/UTIL/Fin4toExcel.xlsm 

I wish to thank Didier Thevenard and Fiona Fenlon of Canadian Solar for their help in developing this VB script.
